# 📘 Internship Daily Work Log

Welcome to my internship logbook! This repository serves as a daily record of my 2-month internship journey. Each day’s entry includes a well-documented Jupyter Notebook covering in-depth notes, hands-on coding exercises, and key takeaways. The goal is to build a structured, professional archive of my learning and practical experience throughout the internship.
