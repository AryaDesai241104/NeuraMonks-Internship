    "### Accuracy Measures in Regression Models\n",
    "\n",
    "In regression, we measure **how close the predicted values are to the actual (true) values**. Unlike classification (where accuracy is a percentage of correct predictions), regression accuracy is measured using **error-based metrics**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most commonly used metrics are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**\n",
    "2. **MSE (Mean Squared Error)**\n",
    "3. **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**\n",
    "4. **R² Score (Coefficient of Determination)**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **MAE – Mean Absolute Error**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition**: The average of the absolute differences between predicted and actual values.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formula**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{MAE} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} |y_i - \\hat{y}_i|\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* $y_i$ = actual value\n",
    "* $\\hat{y}_i$ = predicted value\n",
    "* $n$ = number of data points\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* MAE gives equal weight to all errors.\n",
    "* It tells you the **average magnitude of the errors**, in the same units as the target variable.\n",
    "* Less sensitive to outliers than MSE.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: If MAE = 5, it means your predictions are off by 5 units on average.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **MSE – Mean Squared Error**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition**: The average of the **squared** differences between predicted and actual values.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formula**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{MSE} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Squaring penalizes **larger errors more heavily**.\n",
    "* Good if large errors are especially bad in your application.\n",
    "* More sensitive to outliers than MAE.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Units**: The square of the target variable’s units (e.g., if the target is in dollars, MSE is in dollars²).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **RMSE – Root Mean Squared Error** (Optional, but commonly used)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition**: The square root of MSE.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{RMSE} = \\sqrt{\\text{MSE}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation**: It brings the error back to the same units as the target. Useful for interpreting error size in the context of the original data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **R² Score – Coefficient of Determination**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition**: Measures how well the regression predictions approximate the actual data. It tells you the **proportion of variance** in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formula**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "R^2 = 1 - \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\bar{y})^2}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* $\\bar{y}$ is the mean of the actual values.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* R² = 1: Perfect fit (all points lie on the prediction line).\n",
    "* R² = 0: Model predicts no better than the mean.\n",
    "* R² < 0: Model is worse than using the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* High R² doesn’t always mean a good model — you must also check for overfitting and residuals.\n",
